# Game Engine

A template project for starting a C++ game.
Powered by [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) using [raylib-cpp](https://github.com/RobLoach/raylib-cpp) bindings.

## Getting started

This project relies only on [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to build.
Once installed, simply type `make run` to build the raylib library and the project.

NOTE: the library flags set in the included `Makefile` are set for Windows, and will need to be changed for [Linux](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux) or [MacOS](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux).
